# Eviction Fighter Bot
Chatbot Designed to Help Tenants Facing Eviction and Other Landlord-Tenant Law Issues

## Inspiration
Even though laws many states in the U.S. provide tenants moderate to substantial recourse against negligent or abusive landlords, many tenants remain at a disadvantage when landlord-tenant conflicts arise. Tenants facing eviction or living in poorly maintained buildings often under-utilize legal resources at their disposal.

A chatbot inspired by the "DoNotPay" bot, which was originally created for users in Great Britain to appeal their own parking tickets.

## What it does
This bot is designed to help you understand your rights as a tenant and empower you to take action from anywhere you have an internet connection.

Once the bot has collected sufficient information about a case, it can suggest a course of action for the user, and even (this part is currently being built) generate letters or court filings if necessary. It can also suggest points of contact for in-person legal assistance from a legal aid organization or reduced fee attorney.
